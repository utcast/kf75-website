# Relationship to Research


## Why catechins work

At the tea booth, various properties of tea, which is so familiar to us, are introduced. By the way, how are these effects discovered?

A joint study published in 2019 by the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of the University of Tokyo, the Institute of Industrial Chemistry, Osaka University, and the Drug Discovery Research Organization of the University of Tokyo found that catechins in green tea increase the concentration of SAM (S-adenosyl-L-methionine), which is a potent antioxidant. methionine (S-Adenosyl-L-methionine) in green tea.

SAM is a chemical substance that plays an important role in human cells, but it is known that excessive intake can upset the body's internal clock and that its concentration increases with the development of colon cancer. Therefore, the ability of catechins to lower SAM is a new clue that explains the health benefits of green tea, according to the researchers. The health effects of foods and beverages are not only related to the chemical substances contained in them, but also to the way the body digests and absorbs them, and to the way cells function, making the mechanism very complex. Nevertheless, as in the case of green tea, the effects and mechanisms of these effects are being elucidated day by day through research. Someday, all the health effects of food and drinks can be explained by science... Maybe.


## The Power of Music

Have you ever felt better after listening to music, or had goosebumps? Have you ever had such an experience?

You know that sound is vibration. However, when sound, which is nothing more than vibration, is superimposed and made into music, it has various powers. For example, it can act on the autonomic nervous system, making you feel calm and relaxed, or conversely, raise your heart rate. Hospitals play “healing music” at a tempo that people find comfortable. What triggers these effects?

Research has now shown that it is the chords. Chords are two or more notes sounding at the same time, and they are used in music because people find certain combinations of pitches pleasing. And this particular combination of chords has been found to have an effect on the heart and abdomen. There are also studies and other findings that suggest a relationship between musical experience and language ability. Music heals and inspires people. If research continues, it may help cure illnesses and help people learn languages.



## The Wonder of Buildings and Their Shapes

Suddenly, the two buildings below have a common shape hidden in them.

Can you guess what it is?

Actually, the wall of the building on the left and the roof on the right have the same shape. This shape is called a “bipolar paraboloid. In the figure booth, we showed that cutting a cone yields a parabola, an ellipse, and a hyperbola. A hyperbolic parabola, like the cone, is a surface that, as the name suggests, produces a hyperbola and a parabola when cut.

The hyperbolic paraboloid is used in architecture for structures consisting of thin curved surfaces, called shell structures. In particular, shell structures using hyperbolic paraboloid are called HP shell structures. The advantage of this structure is that it can easily release external forces due to its curved surface and create a thin but strong structure.

By the way, both of the above two buildings are actually associated with the University of Tokyo. The Tokyo Cathedral of St. Mary the Virgin (Yumibari-dake Observatory) was designed by Kenzo Tange, a member of the Department of Architecture, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo), and the Yayoi Auditorium Annex is located on the Yayoi Campus of the University of Tokyo. It is a little far from Komaba, but close to Hongo, so if you are interested, you may want to visit the actual building.


## Capture the crystals

The crystals booth introduces how familiar crystals are to us and what their properties are.

We also introduce what crystals are.

A crystal is actually a group of grains that are arranged in a neat row. Then, don't you want to see with your eyes how the grains are actually lined up?

How small are these tiny grains? They are so small that it is hard to imagine that they are 1/1,000,000 of a millimeter, or 1/1,000,000 of the memory of a ruler you have in your hand! However, human technology is amazing, and microscopes that can see these grains have been developed for quite some time, allowing us to observe how the grains are neatly lined up. It is relatively easy to observe the grains lining up like a still image, but it has been difficult for many years to move from a state where the grains are lined up in pieces to one where they are lined up neatly. This is because it is extremely difficult to predict when and where the grains will line up neatly when they are crystallized in the usual way. However, recent research at the University of Tokyo has finally succeeded in capturing the moment when the grains line up beautifully in slow motion by crystallizing them in a very confined space. This success may further unravel the mysteries of crystals that are still unknown, or may be applied to completely new technologies.
