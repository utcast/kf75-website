# Why do musical instruments make sounds? A Music Show Exploring with Science


There are many kinds of music around us. Many musical instruments are used in them. Have you ever thought about how they make sounds?


In this show, we will introduce how various instruments make sounds. Through interesting experiments and stories, let's learn how the instruments you have played or heard the sound of make sounds!


## How sound is made


To begin with, what is the mechanism of sound? To put it simply, sound is vibration. When you speak, your throat trembles. When you clap your hands, the air near your hands trembles. These vibrations are transmitted to our ears as air tremors, and we hear sound.


## How a stringed instrument works

How do stringed instruments such as guitars and violins create tremor and sound? These instruments have strings, which are like threads. When these strings are rubbed or plucked, they tremble and make sound.


So, how do you change the sound? Actually, you can change the pitch of the sound by changing the length of the strings. When playing the guitar or violin, we change the pitch of the sound by pressing down on the strings with our fingers. This is also done by shortening the strings and changing the pitch of the sound by pressing down on them.

The holes in many stringed instruments also play an important role in making the sound resonate.


In this show, we will explain how such string instruments work using an instrument called a “stringraphy.

## How wind instruments work


How do wind instruments such as recorders and flutes make sound?


When a tube is prepared and a speaker is placed close to its mouth, only the sound at a certain height will be louder. This phenomenon is called resonance, and the louder sound depends on the length of the tube.

In wind instruments such as recorders, the height of the sound is often changed by pressing down on the hole with the finger. This changes the length of the area through which air passes by plugging the hole.


## How reeds work


Some wind instruments, such as the oboe and clarinet, use “reeds” to produce sound. At first glance, a reed looks like just a piece of wood, but how does it make sound?

If you breathe well into the gaps in the reed, a flow of air is created. The air inside the reed will then have less force to push the air outside, and the reed will close as the air outside pushes it closed. However, the reed returns to its original open state because of its elasticity, the force that tries to return it to its original shape. This is repeated at high speed to create tremors and sound.


## How percussion instruments work


Percussion instruments make sounds by vibrating the instrument itself. In this show, we will use a tubular instrument called a “bungee chime” to illustrate this. When the bungee chime is dropped, it makes a sound. When the bungee chime hits the ground, it shakes upon impact. This instrument also changes the pitch of the sound by changing the length of the tube.

The same is true of the xylophone or xylophone, which is made to tremble and produce sounds of various heights by striking different lengths of planks with a bachi.
