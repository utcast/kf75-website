# Let’s find out the secrets of buildings: Exterior & Interior -Architecture Booth-

In this booth, we are going to explain to you the way to make buildings stronger.

## Material

In Japan, wood has long been used to build houses. One reason for this is that there are plenty of trees in Japan. In Europe, on the other hand, stone ones have been constructed because there is plenty of stone.

In recent years, “reinforced concrete" has also been used as a building material. By combining steel, which is strong against pulling forces, and concrete, which is strong against pushing forces, people can create strong material that can withstand both pulling and pushing forces.

## Method of construction 1:Earthquake resistant

If the roof is simply placed on the pillars, the house will soon collapse due to shaking caused by earthquakes. How can we build a house which can withstand shaking? In fact, if you add pillars at an angle, you can make the house more stable. These diagonal columns are called "brace" and a structure that can withstand shaking in this way is called "earthquake-resistant”. By creating triangles which do not change shape compared to squares, a stable building can be built.

## Method of construction 2: Vibration supression

For a very tall building such as Tokyo Skytree, earthquake resistance ,using triangular structure , is not sufficient to withstand shaking. Therefore, a structure called central pillar(Shimbashira) is used. By building the pillar in the center of the tower, it swings in the opposite direction of the earthquake’s movement, thereby reducing the overall swaying of the tower. This is called "vibration control".
