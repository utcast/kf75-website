# Why do balloons float? Balloon Mystery Show!

This is a story about a little adventure in the world of balloons. Two children lost in the world of balloons during a game of hide-and-seek. It seems that in order to return from the balloon world, they have to collect a key. Let's explore the wonder of how things float through the adventure.


## Size and buoyancy of objects

When you try to submerge a balloon in water, you feel a force that makes the balloon float. This force is buoyancy.

Now, which buoyancy force is greater acting on a large balloon or a small balloon? When a large balloon and a small balloon with weights attached are submerged in water, the small balloon sinks more. This indicates that the buoyancy force acting on the larger balloon is greater. In water, the larger the volume of the submerged part, the greater the buoyancy.

## Balloons that float and balloons that do not float

When you hear the word “balloon,” you may think of something that floats in the sky. But balloons that we inflate with our breath do not float. Why is this?

We are surrounded by air, and air has weight. In fact, floating balloons contain helium, a gas that is lighter than air. In other words, floating balloons float using the fact that lighter things float more easily than heavier things.

## Balloons that float with carbon dioxide

A balloon falling downwards is placed in a tube, and hot water is poured on dry ice on top of it to generate carbon dioxide. Then smoke spreads inside the tube and the balloon slowly floats up. Carbon dioxide has the characteristic of being heavier than air. As the carbon dioxide spreads inside the tube, the balloon becomes lighter than its surroundings. In fact, when it weighs less than its surroundings, things float.

## Helium balloons in a train

When a train starts to run forward, we feel an opposite force pulling us backward. However, the helium balloon is tilted forward in the same direction as the train is moving. This can be explained by the fact that buoyancy works in the opposite direction of gravity, which is the downward force we are subjected to. When the train starts to move forward and we feel a backward force, it is because gravity is tilted slightly backward. In this case, the buoyancy force of the helium balloon is opposite to gravity, so we can think of it as a slight forward tilt. This is why the balloon tilts in the opposite direction of the force we feel.

## How balloons work

How does a balloon float?

Balloons float by using the property of air that it becomes larger when it is warmed up. When the air inside a balloon is warmed, the size of the air increases and the air is pushed outward. The weight of the air inside becomes lighter than the weight of the air outside, and the balloon floats.

## Column

In the balloon experiment, we explained that balloons use the property of air to increase in size when it is warmed up. Here is an experiment using balloons that confirms this property. <br><br><br>

(1) Inflate a balloon slightly and attach it to a plastic bottle so that it covers the mouth of the bottle. <br> <br>

(2) Place one plastic bottle in the freezer and the other in a warm place. <br>

3) Wait for a few minutes and then compare the sizes of the balloons. <br><br>

A balloon in a plastic bottle in the freezer will sink a little, while a balloon placed in a warm place will expand even more. Air is made up of very small “molecules”. In a cold place, the molecules do not move much and are tightly packed together, so the size (volume) of the air becomes smaller. On the other hand, in a warm place, molecules move around actively, and the force to spread out becomes stronger, so the size (volume) of the air becomes larger. This is why air becomes larger when it is warm.
