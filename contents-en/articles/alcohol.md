In this booth, we are going to explain to you the various chemical properties of alcohol.

## Alcoholic fermentation

Ethanol, a type of alcohols, can be produced by yeast. The reaction in which glucose is decomposed by yeast to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide is called alcohol fermentation. When glucose is dissolved in water and yeast are mixed and heated, this reaction occurs. Ethanol can be detected by  an alcohol checker and carbon dioxide generates bubbles.

## Pen and alcohol

In general, there are two types of pens: water-based and oil-based. Since water and oil have different molecular structures and do not blend with each other, water can only erace drawings with water-based pen, and the same is true for oil and oil-based one. However, both can be removed with ethanol. The reason for this is that ethanol molecules have both water-like and oil-like structures, making them compatible with both water and oil.

## Protein and alcohol

When alcohol is added to egg whites, a white haze-like substance is produced. This is due to a change in the structure of the protein contained in the egg whites. Originally, proteins are in the form of chains, but heating or adding alcohol to them can break these chains. This is called "denaturation" of proteins. Similar to the pen-and-alcohol experiment, alcohol's ability to break protein chains is due to the fact that alcohol molecules have a structure that is compatible with water.

Proteins are found in all living things on earth, including us. Alcohol is used for sanitization because it can denature the surface membranes of bacteria and viruses, killing or detoxifying them.
