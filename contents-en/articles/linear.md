# Aim to be the fastest at Komaba Festival! Linear Booth


## Introduction

In this booth, we will be looking at the Linear Motor Car, which is currently under development in Japan and will soon become the new generation of vehicles. Let's take a look together to see why linear trains are much faster than conventional vehicles.

## Air Resistance

Everything in the world is subjected to a force from the air in the opposite direction to the direction it is moving. This force is called aerodynamic drag. When you run, you may have felt the wind coming from the front.

Whenever you try to increase the speed of anything, the air resistance slows it down. So what is the difference between a conventional train and a linear train? Conventional trains are constructed in such a way that they are subject to the full force of the air.

On the other hand, a linear train has a structure that is able to channel the force of the air. This pointed shape is called streamlined. This shape was inspired by birds and other animals. The streamlined structure reduces the effect of air resistance that conventional trains are subjected to.

## Frictional force

When something moves, there is a force between it and the object it is in contact with that prevents it from moving. This force is called frictional force. In an ordinary train, frictional force is generated between the wheels and the track, and all the force exerted is not used for speed.

To solve this problem, linear trains use the power of magnets. As you may know, magnets have S and N poles, which attract and repel each other. In a linear train, magnets are installed in the car body and on the tracks, respectively.

This attraction and repulsion between the car body and the rails of the linear allows the car body to float and not be affected by frictional forces. This use of magnets to levitate is called magnetic levitation, and a linear using this mechanism is specifically called a magnetic levitation linear.


## How a Linear goes!

As explained in the frictional force section, the linear runs in a floating state. Here, I would like you to think of an ordinary train. An ordinary train actually moves forward by turning its wheels.

However, this is not possible in a linear train. Then, how in the world does it move forward? Actually, the force of magnets is involved here as well. As I mentioned earlier, magnets are installed in the body of the linear train and on the tracks. However, ordinary magnets do not work well.

This is where electromagnets come in. An electromagnet is a magnet that becomes a magnet by passing an electric current through a coil. The greatest advantage of electromagnets is that they can switch between S and N poles.

By alternately switching the S and N poles, it is possible to advance the car body. By using this mechanism, it is possible to run a linear train even when it is floating.

## Column

We were talking about linear trains and I asked him, “Well, do you know when the plan to run them by the power of magnets started? Actually, it started more than 60 years ago, in 1962!” You may be surprised to hear that.

Although it is often thought of as a modern technology, it actually has a long history. During this period, there was growing interest in the possibilities of high-speed travel in Japan and around the world, and scientists and engineers were dreaming about it.

Many studies and experiments have been conducted to realize the linear train. In particular, a mechanism to levitate the car body using magnetic levitation technology and thereby reduce frictional force was a major challenge. Thus, through years of effort, the current technology of linear trains that can travel comfortably at high speeds is nearing completion.

The linear train, which is the result of a fusion of past efforts and state-of-the-art technology, is a highly anticipated means of transportation for the future.
