What has been essential to human development? Inspiration, technology, and luck. However these are not all. In this booth, we will spotlight the "light", the entity that illuminates the darkness and enables us to work even in the darkest of nights.
We are waiting for you with three experiments that trace the history of light, including a glittering experiment using LEDs and an experiment that recreates the feats of the genius Edison!

## Experiments
### -Incandescent lamp

The incandescent lamp is the first fireless light developed by mankind. This time, we made a simple incandescent lamp and used a mechanical pencil lead as a filament. In the experiment, we will not only make it glow, but also verify how the incandescent lamp can remain lit for a long period of time.

### -Fluorescent light tube

Do you know how fluorescent lamps work? Fluorescent bulbs were developed to overcome the disadvantages of incandescent lamps, which get hot and burn out. They use plasma and fluorescent paint that reacts to ultraviolet light. In the exhibition, we will show you how the plasma emits light and how the fluorescent stone looks like.

### -LED Cube

Developed 60 years after fluorescent lamps, LEDs are safer and more sustainable than their fluorescent counterparts. The greatest advantage of LEDs is that they are easy to control. In this exhibit, visitors will experiment with controlling a device that combines 512 LEDs to create various patterns.
