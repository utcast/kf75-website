# Feel the wind! Look up at the sky! Weather Mechanism Show

## Wind

Wind blows when you walk outside. It is a very familiar weather phenomenon, but do you know the principle behind it?

Why does wind blow? The answer lies in atmospheric pressure. Although we cannot usually feel it, air has weight. And air moves from the direction of higher atmospheric pressure. The flow of air at this time is called wind.

## Front

Do you know the term "front"?

A front is the border between warm and cold air.

Due to the nature of warm air going over cold air, the warm air goes around the cold air, creating a front.

In this show, we will use water instead of air to recreate the warm air going around on top.

## Tornado

A tornado, also known as a tornado, is a natural phenomenon caused by an updraft. The term is a bit difficult to understand, but due to the law of conservation of angular motion, the smaller the vortex, the faster it rotates. Therefore, a fast and thin tornado is created when a slow vortex of air on the ground is stretched vertically by an updraft.

In this show, a machine called a blower is used to create the vortex, and a ventilation fan to suck in the air is used to simulate a tornado.

## Downburst

A downburst is when cold air blown down from an incoming cloud hits the ground and spreads as strong winds. It can be powerful enough to knock down trees and utility poles. Hail and hail fall from clouds because the updrafts can no longer hold them in place, and when they fall, they entrain the air around them as they fall.

In this show, dry ice and soap film will be used to recreate the downburst.

## Rainbow

Rainbows are all around you. What is the principle behind it? The principle of a rainbow can be explained by two things: the sun's light is a mixture of various colors and the refraction of light. Sunlight is white, but this is not because of white light, but because of the mixture of red, blue, green, and other colors.

Also, the ease with which light can pass through different objects differs. When light passes through objects with different ease of passage, it is called refraction. The way light is refracted also differs depending on the color of the light.

In other words, a rainbow is made up of many different colors of light, and the different colors of the rainbow are created by the different ways in which the light is refracted.

## Sunset

Why are sunsets orange? This has to do with a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Light is visible as a color when it is scattered as it passes through the air.

And light is scattered differently depending on its color. For example, blue scatters more easily than red.

Therefore, when the sun is rising, only blue scatters and the sky looks blue because there is less air that has to pass through.

However, as the sun begins to set and more air has to pass through, blue light scatters closer to the sun and only red light scatters closer to the sun, making the sky appear red at sunset.

## Columns

Have you ever heard proverbs about the weather? For example, "When a frog croaks, it rains" or "Morning mist is fine. One of them is "Sunset is fine, morning mist is rain. In this column, I would like to introduce this proverb.

Because of the westerly winds blowing over Japan, the weather shifts from west to east. If you see a sunset, it means that there are few clouds in the western direction, so you can predict that the next day will be sunny. We can trust "sunset means clear skies". On the other hand, what about "morning glow"? We know that the east side is clear, but the weather moves from west to east, so the weather on the east side has nothing to do with the upcoming weather. However, in spring and summer, when the weather changes rapidly, it often rains after a clear day. In other words, after the morning glow is seen, it often rains after the clearing passes. Therefore, it is said that "morning glow is rain.
