## Camera Obscura

Craft a model of a camera in which the view around you appears to be upside down. Cameras use lenses and film. The lens collects light by "refracting" it. By adjusting the position of the lens so that the light is focused on the film, the film will reflect the surrounding scenery.

Let's learn more about "refraction of light" while making a model of a camera!

## Polarizer Kaleidoscope

This class will create a kaleidoscope that changes color as you spin it around. Put a transparent board with cellophane tape between two black boards! You can see colorful patterns. The black plate is actually a polarizing plate, which allows light to pass through only in a certain direction. The cellophane tape bends the direction of light for each color, making it appear more colorful.

Why not make a kaleidoscope and see the colorful world?
