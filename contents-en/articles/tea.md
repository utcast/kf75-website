# Let's get to know each other! Let's take a peek! What's in the Tea Booth

What do you think of when you hear the word “tea”? There are many different types of tea, including green tea, barley tea, black tea, and oolong tea. However, few people know what the difference is between green tea and barley tea. Thus, while tea is familiar to us, its contents are not well known in detail.
In this booth, through experiments using green tea and barley tea, we will introduce the differences between green tea and barley tea and the interesting properties of catechins and caffeine contained in tea in an easy-to-understand manner!

## Detection reaction of caffeine

When you hear the word caffeine, you probably think of coffee or tea. Actually, caffeine is also found in green tea and is the source of the bitter taste of tea. However, it is not found in barley tea, which is also a type of tea. In this booth, visitors will see that green tea reacts to caffeine but barley tea does not, and that there is a difference in the reaction between green tea made with water and that made with hot water, to confirm that there is a difference in the amount of caffeine in tea. ## Catechin Detection Reaction.

## Detection and reaction of catechins

Using the same amount of tea leaves, brew green tea with hot and cold water, respectively. Comparing the resulting teas, you will notice that the green tea brewed with hot water is darker in color.

This is because the amount of ingredients that dissolve in the tea varies depending on the temperature. In particular, caffeine and catechins tend to dissolve more easily at high temperatures, so tea brewed with hot water will be darker. This difference also affects the taste and aroma, so brewing tea in a different way can broaden the enjoyment of tea.

## Antioxidant effect of catechins

First, prepare two grated apples. Pour water and green tea over each and observe the changes. In this experiment, we see that the apple with green tea on it does not turn brown easily when exposed to air.
This phenomenon is due to the antioxidant effect of catechins contained in green tea. Catechins prevent oxidation of apples, thereby reducing discoloration. Catechins also work in our bodies to prevent cell oxidation and support good health.
