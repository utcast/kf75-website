# Let's feel it! The Wonder of Shapes Shape Booth

## Introduction
What do you think of when you hear the word “figure”? Triangles, rectangles, circles, ......, and many more. In this booth, we will conduct various experiments on the relationship between unusual shapes and the things around us.

## Parabolas and parabolic antennas!

A parabola is a curve with the property that light or radio waves incident parallel to the axial direction from its apex are concentrated at a single point (focal point). This property is utilized in the design of parabolic antennas and reflecting telescopes. In a parabolic antenna, radio waves are reflected along a parabolic surface, which causes the radio waves to converge at the focal point of the parabola. This allows the antenna to efficiently collect radio waves and catch signals from distant broadcasters. Furthermore, the concentration of radio waves at the focal point enables the antenna to provide high-sensitivity reception, a technique used in television and radio broadcasting.

## Properties of an Ellipse
An ellipse has two focal points, and light or sound emitted from either focal point has the property of being concentrated at the other focal point. This property plays an important role in acoustics and optics. For example, in an elliptical room, the “whispering corridor” phenomenon occurs when the voice of a person standing at one focal point tends to reach the person at the other focal point directly. Reflective lights and telescopes in operating rooms also take advantage of this bifocality and are designed to efficiently focus light and sound waves at a focal point.

## Cone Curve

Parabolas and ellipses are called “conic curves” and are shapes obtained by cutting a cone at a specific angle. Conical curves have different properties depending on the angle of the cut, and these include circles and hyperbolas as well as parabolas and ellipses. These conic curves are not only an abstract mathematical concept, but actually have many properties that are useful in physics and engineering and have a wide variety of applications.

## Cycloids and temple roofs!

A cycloid is the path drawn by a particular point when rolling a circle, also known as the fastest descent curve. The cycloid has the property of being the fastest descending down a slope, and in the field of architecture, this shape has influenced the shape of roofs in traditional Japanese architecture because of its ability to drain snow and rain efficiently.

## End
Each of these shapes has its own unique properties and is not just a mathematical concept, but has real life applications. Whether it is the focal point of a parabola in a parabolic antenna, the bifocal nature of an ellipse in acoustics and optics, or the cycloid that weatherproofs buildings, mathematical theories and properties are hidden behind the shapes of the objects we see and tools we use in our daily lives. You will gain new perspectives on various shapes and structures in our daily lives!
