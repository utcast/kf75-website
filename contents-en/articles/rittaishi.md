Have you ever seen a picture that appears to pop out when you wear red and blue glasses? The method of seeing things in three dimensions is called "stereopsis. Stereopsis can make a picture that is supposed to be drawn on a flat surface appear to be three-dimensional.

There are two types of stereopsis: one is due to the fact that we have two eyes, and the other is due to the mechanism of our brain. In this booth, visitors will experience an experiment that shows how we usually perceive things as three-dimensional. There will be a lot of mysterious experiments that go back and forth between two-dimensional and three-dimensional.

Welcome to the world of stereopsis.

## Naked-eye stereopsis

Naked-eye stereopsis is to see flat images three-dimensionally without using tools such as the red and blue glasses shown in this booth. Here, we will introduce the crossed-eye method, which is one of the methods of naked-eye stereopsis. Since it is difficult at first, let's try it together with your family.

### What is the crossing method?

This is a method in which the left side of the image is viewed with the right eye and the right side is viewed with the left eye. In this case, as shown in Figure 1, your eyes should be in focus between the two images.

### How to do the crossing method

First, lean in. It is easier to do this by placing a pencil or other object between the face and the picture and staring at the tip of the pencil or object. Note that the picture should not be in focus. Then the picture appears to be doubled, as shown in Figure 2. At this point, you see four dots on the picture. Keep moving your eyes so that a part of the double picture overlaps and three dots are visible. If you keep this eye position, you will be able to see 3D.

### Let's try naked-eye stereopsis

Naked-eye stereo vision can be used to view the following images and to search for mistakes. In the two pictures above, try shifting your eyes so that the circles in the upper part of the picture overlap. By the way, if you search for "stereogram" on the Internet, you will find various pictures similar to this one.

If you shift your eyes so that the two pictures on the right overlap, only the different parts on the left and right appear to be out of alignment. (There are six mistakes.)

## Stereopsis, stars, and celestial motion

How did scientists measure the distance from the earth to the stars in the night sky? Actually, the mechanism introduced in the stereoscopic booth is applied here as well.

Since our two eyes are separated by a few centimeters, there is a discrepancy in the way our two eyes see a single object. From the degree of this discrepancy, we can determine the distance to the object. However, no one can look at the night sky and sense which stars are close to the earth and which stars are far away. Stars are so far away that even if both eyes are separated by a few centimeters, it is impossible to recognize the difference in visibility.

So, should we observe it at two points on the earth at the same time? Unfortunately, this is still too close. In fact, a method using the Earth's orbital motion is used.

As shown in the figure, the earth revolves around the sun. This means that if we observe a star twice, with a time interval of half a year, we will have seen it from two different locations, each about 300 million kilometers away from the orbital diameter. In this way, we can finally determine the discrepancy in the way the star is seen and calculate the distance to the star.

The difference in the visibility of stars due to orbital motion is called the "precession parallax.

Even so, the stars are so far away that the annual parallax is very small. In the days when observation was still inaccurate, it was not possible to detect any annual parallax. This is said to have been one of the reasons why people at that time rejected the geocentric theory and believed in the heliocentric theory.
