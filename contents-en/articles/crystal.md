# Tiny grains, big changes! Crystal Booth


What do you think of when you hear the word “crystal”? Most people probably think of snowflakes. However, there are so many other crystals around us that we can't even begin to count them.


So, what kind of things are crystals? How are crystals formed? Have you ever wondered these questions? In the crystal booth, we will answer these questions by using beautiful crystals and conducting various experiments for your enjoyment.


## How to make crystals?

Have you ever thought about how crystals are made? In this experiment, we will show you the easiest way to make crystals. Here we will use a substance called ammonium chloride, which is often used as a fertilizer for plants. Substances that are soluble in water have the property that the amount of solubility limit changes as the temperature of the water changes. For example, in the case of carbonated water, when carbonated water is heated up, the carbonation is rapidly lost. This is because the amount of carbon dioxide that can dissolve in carbonated water decreases as the temperature of the water increases. On the other hand, many solids, including ammonium chloride, have the property of increasing their maximum solubility in water as the water temperature is raised. In other words, after dissolving a large amount of ammonium chloride in hot water, when the water is cooled, the solubility limit of ammonium chloride decreases, and what is no longer soluble in water becomes crystals. This method of forming crystals is called recrystallization.


## Crystals and electricity

Let us check the structure of crystals by applying electricity to them. First, let us compare two types of charcoal, charcoal and binchotan. Charcoal is made of very small carbon grains. Charcoal contains many impurities in addition to carbon, so electricity does not flow properly because the carbon grains are arranged in pieces. Binchotan, on the other hand, has carbon grains that are arranged so neatly that electricity flows smoothly. Thus, there is a big difference even among charcoals that look similar to each other. Binchotan with grains neatly lined up is called crystalline. On the other hand, when the grains are arranged in pieces, it is called amorphous.


Next, let us consider salt crystals. Salt crystals have a structure in which the grains are originally hand in hand, so even if you tried to conduct electricity through them, there would be almost no flow because there is not enough power to conduct electricity. So what should we do to make electricity flow? In fact, if you dissolve the grains in water, the grains are separated from each other and can hold electricity, so electricity can flow smoothly.


## Dutch tears

The word amorphous was mentioned before, and glass is a typical example of amorphous material. Finally, as a bonus, I would like to explain a glass with a curious property called “Dutch tears,” which is shown in the photo. This small glass is so impact-resistant and unbreakable that it cannot be broken even when struck with a hammer. In fact, this glass is made by heating ordinary glass to the point where it becomes liquid, and then cooling it rapidly in water. This is the same process used to make tempered glass, which is used for window glass and smartphone screens. However, it also has a weakness: if you cut the sharp part like the tail in the photo, it shatters easily. This phenomenon occurs because the glass made as described above is solid with a strong force applied to the inside, and when the tail is cut, the balance of the force is suddenly disrupted.

## End
I hope everyone's image of crystals has changed from what we have seen so far. I hope you have learned that crystals have a lot to do with the properties of things in our daily lives. I encourage everyone to stop and look for crystals and amorphous materials in their daily lives.
